# SocialMedia
In this project I made a dynamic social media app like twitter using Django, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

# How this project works
#### This project has many functions in Django to make it work let's name all of them: ####
* Index Page 
* Create Post
* Following Page
* Userprofile Page
* Count the User's amount of Following and Followers
* Follow/Unfollow
* Login/Register/Logout
#### Javascript is also very important because in Django we have to refresh in order to preform a function. But, sometimes refreshing the page is not an option. Here you will see all the functions that needed an API: ####
* The Like/Unlike button
* The Edit button

#### Lastly, I wanted to talk about how implimenting all these functions was a great learning experience. I think this project gave me an insight of what software engineering is. I will continue to learn more everyday as I tackle on other projects whether it's working for a company or just a hobby project of mine.  ####
